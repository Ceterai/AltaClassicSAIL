A tiny patch that replaces visuals of the default alta S.A.I.L. with a vanilla-looking one, colored in main alta palettes.

This is for people who don't use Customizable A.I. but still want the alternative visuals.

You can also use both (Customizable A.I. S.A.I.L. chip and this patch) to get the full experience, since CAI doesn't replace radio message portraits (and this patch does).

It only updates Alta Species S.A.I.L. and requires My Enternia to work (obviously).
